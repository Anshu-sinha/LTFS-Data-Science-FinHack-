Vehicle Loan Default Prediction
Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This hasled to the tightening up of vehicle
loan underwriting and increased vehicle loan rejection rates. The need for a better credit risk scoring model is also raised by these 
Institutions.This warrants a study to estimate the determinants of vehicleloan default. A financial institution has  hired you to
accurately predict the probability of loanee/borrower defaulting on a vehicle loan in the f irst EMI(Equated Monthly Instalments)
on the due date. Following Informat ion regarding the loan andloanee are provided in the datasets:
•	Loanee Information (Demographic data like age,Identity proof etc.)
•	Loan Information (Disbursal details,loan to value ratio etc.)
•	Bureau data & history (Bureau score,number of active accounts, the status of other loans.credit history etc.)

Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and Important determinants can be identified which can be 
further used for minimising the default rates.
